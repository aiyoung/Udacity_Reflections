Manual vs. Automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatcially stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It's a good idea to always pull changes manually from a remote repository because a colaborator might have made changes to the project that you might not what in your local master branch. Or you might want to fold those changes into a different branch on your local machine.
