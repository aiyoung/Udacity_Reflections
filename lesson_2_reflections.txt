Reflection: Staging Area. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think the staging area offers?

A: The staging area is where you can group files to be added as a commit to a repository. 

by using staging area's, one can group project that contains many files and whose strucuture may be dictated by a given programming language, complier, into different logical constructs. 

I think that the benifit of a stanging area is that one can make various commit groups that aren't dictated by the file strucuture required by a complier. I bet you can make them across smaller projects as well. 

The double edged sword of this is that you can make some really complated commit structures that could be difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with the overall project to follow. 

Reflection: Commit Size. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Well, you choose what files that have changed to throw into the staging area before you commit. 

Reflection: When to use branches. 

What are some situations where branches would be helpful in keeping your histroy organized? How would branches help?

A: well in the case where one wants to experiment branches could be helpful. 

or if one has a big feature they want to eventually roll into the master branch, but want to keep the master branch clean while they work on that new feature. 

Branches are neat!. 

So, if you've changed several files, you can add those files to different commits. One per logical change. 

Reflection: Visualizing with Diagrams.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help you visualize what nodes various branches sprung from, points they merged, etc. 

I think it'd be worth looking into that git flow stuff people were talking about online that makes visualizing a given git repository easier than the current ASCII like stuff of git log --graph or whatever the command was.
